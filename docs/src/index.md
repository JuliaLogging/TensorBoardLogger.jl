# TensorBoardLogger.jl

*Log data to TensorBoard from Julia*

[TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/summaries_and_tensorboard) is an
interactive dashboard that can be used to visualize data generated from your programs.
**TensorBoardLogger** is a [Julia](https://julialang.org) package that allows
you to log data to TensorBoard through the standard Julia Logging system.

## Installation

To install this Julia package run the following command in the julia REPL:
```
] add TensorBoardLogger
```

!!! note
    If you need to log audio files, you must also install `WAV`.
    If you need to log Images, you must also install `ImageMagick`
    (on MacOS, you will also need `QuartzImageIO`).
    You only need to install those dependencies, and you will never need to load them.
    ```
    ] add ImageMagick
    ```
!!! note
    *TensorBoardLogger* only contains code to serialize data to TensorBoard.
    To run the TensorBoard interface, you should install it and run it.
    The easiest way to install it is to [install TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install).
    Instructions for running TensorBoard can be found [on the GitHub page](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard).



## Basic Usage
```@meta
CurrentModule = TensorBoardLogger
```

The fundamental type defined in this package is a `TBLogger`, which behaves like
other standard loggers in Julia such as `ConsoleLogger` or `TextLogger`. You can
create one by passing it the path to the folder where you want to store the data.
You can also pass an optional second argument to specify the behaviour in case
there given path exists.

Once you have created a `TBLogger`, you can use it as you would use any other
logger in Julia:
- You can set it to be your global logger with the function [`global_logger`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Logging/index.html#Base.CoreLogging.global_logger)
- You can set it to be the current logger in a scope with the function [`with_logger`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Logging/index.html#Base.CoreLogging.with_logger)
- You can combine it with other Loggers using [LoggingExtras.jl](https://github.com/oxinabox/LoggingExtras.jl), so that messages are logged to TensorBoard and to other backends at the same time.

Every `TBLogger` has an internal counter to store the current `step`, which is initially set to `1`. All the data logged with the same `@log` call will be logged with the same step, and then
it will increment the internal counter by 1.

If you want to increase the counter by a different amount, or prevent it from increasing, you can log the additional message
`log_step_increment=N`. The default behaviour corresponds to `N=1`. If you set `N=0` the internal counter will not be modified.
The defaul behaviour for logger `lg` can be changed executing `set_step_increment!(lg, N)`.

See the example below:
```julia
using TensorBoardLogger, Logging, Random

lg=TBLogger("tensorboard_logs/run", min_level=Logging.Info)

struct sample_struct first_field; other_field; end

with_logger(lg) do
    for i=1:100
        x0          = 0.5+i/30; s0 = 0.5/(i/20);
        edges       = collect(-5:0.1:5)
        centers     = collect(edges[1:end-1] .+0.05)
        histvals    = [exp(-((c-x0)/s0)^2) for c=centers]
        data_tuple  = (edges, histvals)
        data_struct = sample_struct(i^2, i^1.5-0.3*i)


        @info "test" i=i j=i^2 dd=rand(10).+0.1*i hh=data_tuple
        @info "test_2" i=i j=2^i hh=data_tuple log_step_increment=0
        @info "" my_weird_struct=data_struct   log_step_increment=0
        @debug "debug_msg" this_wont_show_up=i
    end
end
```

## Backends

*TensorBoardLogger* supports five backends:
    - Scalars
    - Distributions
    - Images
    - Audio
    - Text/Markdown

When you log data to tensorboard, it is processed to convert it to the format
used by TensorBoard.
In particoular, fields in structures are logged individually individually and complex
numbers/arrays are split into their real and imaginary parts. Depending on it's type, an
object is serialized to the relevant backend, with the text backend being the
default fallback.

For more detailed informations on how data is dispatched to a certain backend, and
how to specify a desired backend refer to [Specifying a backend](@ref).

If you want to define a new default behaviour for a custom type refer to section
[Extending TensorBoardLogger](@ref).

## Deserialization

If you want to read back the data stored in TensorBoard/.proto files, have a look
at [Reading back TensorBoard data](@ref)

## Third-party packages
We also support logging custom types from a the following third-party libraries:
 - [Plots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl): the `Plots.Plot` type will be rendered to PNG at the resolution specified by the object and logged as an image
 - [PyPlot.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyPlot.jl): the `PyPlot.Figure` type will be rendered to PNG at the resolution specified by the object and logged as an image
 - [Tracker.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/Tracker.jl): the `TrackedReal` and `TrackedArray` types will be logged as vector data
 - [ValueHistories.jl](https://github.com/JuliaML/ValueHistories.jl): the `MVHistory` type is used to store the deserialized content of .proto files.

## Explicit logging

In alternative, you can also log data to TensorBoard through it's functional interface,
by calling the relevant method with a tag string and the data. For information
on this interface refer to [Explicit interface]@ref()...
